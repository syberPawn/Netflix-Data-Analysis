    "\n",
    "#### Patterns & Trends:\n",
    "- TV Shows and Movies are nearly balanced, with a slight edge towards Movies.\n",
    "- Most content was added in recent years (peak around 2018â€“2020).\n",
    "- Top genres include *Dramas*, *International Movies*, and *Comedies*.\n",
    "- Movie durations vary widely, but many fall between 80 to 120 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notable Anomalies:\n",
    "- Some entries have missing `cast`, `director`, or `country`.\n",
    "- A few shows/movies have extremely long or short durations, which may be data errors or rare content types.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Implications:\n",
    "- Netflix may prioritize adding international and drama content to appeal to a broad audience.\n",
    "- Trends can help content teams decide future investments in TV Shows vs. Movies.\n",
    "- Understanding peak content years can assist in planning content acquisition.\n",
